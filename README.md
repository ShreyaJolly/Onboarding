# The Survival Guide to working with us

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/neuropsychology/Onboarding?label=last%20update)

**Welcome to the team!** üéâ Whether you're a student, an intern or a colleague, joining a new work environment can be a bit stressful. In order to ease your first days and set you up for the future, we compiled this guide and hope that you will find it useful.

The goal of this guide is first and foremost to help you acquire the **same frame of reference**, so you can then understand what we are talking about, the issues that we face and the solutions that we find. However, it is possible that some of the advice or things here might at first seem weird or useless. Trust us though, it will become handy some day üòâ

This guide has been crafted by all **past and current members of the team**. It's our collective legacy, and it will be yours too. As such, by the end of your journey here, we hope that you will leave your mark in this document, by updating / improving / revising some of its content. Don't worry, you will see *how* to do that later.


## Questions

> **I feel a bit lost**

Send us a message, we're likely unaware of that!

> **I'm not sure what I should do and what my tasks are**

Send us a message, we're likely unaware of that!

> **There's too much work for me**

Send us a message, we're likely unaware of that!

> **There's not enough work for me**

Send us a message, we're likely unaware of that!

In short, for any reason, **do not hestitate to drop us a message!**

## Our vision

Our team in centred around core values such as **teamwork**, continuous **learning**, **friendly** environment and **aiming for the top**.

We rely on a lot of internal **communication** (about stuff more or less related to work :grin:), our ability to keep on learning and improving, a cool working environment (forget the formalities, ain't nobody got time for that!) and striving for the highest standards in terms of sciencific quality and honesty. We're strongly committed to **open-science**, i.e., working open by sharing our code, documentation, data (where possible) and expertise.

On a more abstract level, I believe in what I call the **three-fold neuropsychology skill set**. In short, I think that a neuropsychologist (and, by extension, people working on-related topics) should aim (when applicable) at developping 3 types of expertise: **clinical abilities** (neuro/psycho-pathology, assessment, therapy & rehabilitation, ...), **technical skills**  (statistics, programming, signal processsing, ...) and **theoretical knowledge** (a diversified knowledge and understanding of the psychological and neuroscientific theories, frameworks and their history).


## Roadmap <sub>(05-06-2020)</sub>

*Note: this roadmap is typically something that has to be updated by the team, it's our collective responsibility. So if you notice that it's outdated, do make a Pull Request (see below if you don't know what it is) to update it!*

Here are the projects that our team is currently working on:

- [The Structure of Deception: Validation of the Lying Profile Questionnaire](https://psyarxiv.com/t7s32/)

- [NeuroKit2: The Python Toolbox for Neurophysiological Signal Processing](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit)

- [Psychological Determinants of the Susceptibility to Fake News amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic](https://osf.io/79uvk/)

- The Process Model of Lying and Deception: The Study of Mental and Physiological Process of Deception



## üìÜ Day 1: Enter the world

### 1. Explore your environment

Pay a visit to your colleagues, introduce yourself, explore the building, locate the offices, find the toilets and the coffee machine.

### 2. Get the Admin done

Do whatever is required on the admin side, complete the ethical certification, the mandatory trainings, etc. Specifically at NTU, this often involves completing short courses online:
- CITI Certification (on ethics and integrity in research)
- WorkDay mandatory courses (if you are an employee) that pop up from time to time

### 3. Get connected

#### üê¶ **Twitter**

We believe that the best way to start this journey is to get out there, listen to the ongoing discourses and get publicly engaged. And [Twitter](https://twitter.com/home) might be the very platform to do it üòâ It's great for the research arena because researchers can recruit participants for experiments and easily share and summarize their findings in threads, so you can keep up with the latest scientific news here. If you don't believe us, check-out this [**book about Twitter for researchers**](https://t4scientists.com/).

We have compiled a list of interesting accounts for you to start following, covering all sort of different topics (but always relevant). Later, don't forget to make a **pull request** (wondering what is a *pull request*? Continue to read) to add on to the list your favourite accounts!

Open them all in different tabs (`CTRL + Left Click`) and follow them **all** (even if you don't see any reason for it *at first*):

#### üë®‚Äçüî¨ **ResearchGate**

[ResearchGate](https://researchgate.com/home) is a professional networking site for scientists and researchers to share, discover and discuss research. (It's like a researchers' version of *LinkedIn*). You can see what kinds of projects others are currently working on, and their past manuscripts and publications. You can also post and answer questions, as well as recommend certain works! So create an account and start following us and the researchers you like.


#### :octocat: **GitHub**

As GitHub claims itself, it *brings together the world's largest community of developers to discover, share, and build better software*. Whether you're a beginner to programming or an expert, integrating into this community means you'll be constantly learning. It is a place where projects are shared openly and transparently, and you can simply *watch* any repository you're interested in to receive notifications of relevant updates.

## üìÜ Day 2: Get familiar with the workflow


### Create your first Github Pull Requests (PR)

As said earlier, **we use GitHub a lot**, so it's a pre-requisite that you acquire this skill. However, it's quite tricky to get familiar and comfortable with it (even we struggle sometimes), and I'd say it's one of the most complicated thing you'll have to learn. But you cannot learn if you don't try, break things and succeed.

1. **Setting up your profile on the lab website**

The first task is to set-up your profile on the [lab website](http://clinicalbrainlab.github.io).

- **Step 1: Fork the website repository**
  - Go to the (Github Page Repository of Clinical Brain Lab)[https://github.com/ClinicalBrainLab/clinicalbrainlab.github.io]
  - Hit the **fork** button at the top right corner to make a *copy* of the repository in your Github account.

    ![fork](https://github.com/neuropsychology/Onboarding/blob/master/img/fork-repo.png)

   -  After a few minutes of waiting, you should now see a repository with a name of `your-username/clinicalbrainlab.github.io`.

 - **Step 2: Add your profile to the website**
   - In your newly *copied* repository, navigate to the folder `your-username/clinicalbrainlab.github.io/content`. This is where all the concent of the website is stored.
   - Can you guess which file is the one storing the profiles of our lab members? By intuition or by try-and-error, you should now click on the file `people.Rmd`. The extension *.Rmd* stands for **markdown** (or more specifically **R markdown** here). Don't worry too much if you are not familiar with the term. Read on!
   - By reading through the `people.Rmd` file, you can see that it's just like any another word document (except more powerful ^^). The "#" is used to create the sections. You should now click on the *pencil* symbol at the top of the document to start editing.
   - Locate the "section" that you belong to; whether you are a member of **Research Scientists and Research Fellows** or a member of the **Undergraduate Students**. If you can't find a section that accurately captures your role in the lab, do not hesitate to create a new one!
   - Now, you can simply look at what is being written under the name of other members, copy it, and customize the section to make it yours!

  - **Step 3: Add your profile picture**
    - The very last step for you to customize your profile is to add a picture of yourself. Did you see this strange-looking line `<img src="/img/someone-name.jpg" alt="someone-name" width="25%" align="left" hspace=20" vspace="20"><br />`? This line helps to add your picture to your profile.
    - Look for that one picture of yourself that you look the most amazing and upload it to the `your-username/clinicalbrainlab.github.io/static/img` folder. You can name the file with a simple name e.g. your-name üòä
    - Go back to the `people.Rmd` file and in that strange-looking line, replace `someone-name.jpg` with the name of your picture file and its extension. So that it knows where to look for your picture.

  - **Step 4: Make a Pull Request**
    - You are almost finished! Go back to `your-username/clinicalbrainlab.github.io` main page to look for the *Pull Rquest* sign. Click on it.

      ![PR](https://github.com/neuropsychology/Onboarding/blob/master/img/PR.png)

    - The page will show that you are trying to make a Pull Request from **your** repositorty *"your-username/clinicalbrainlab.github.io"* to the **original** repository *clinicalbrainlab/clinicalbrainlab.github.io"*. Please make sure that the base is `sources`.
    - All the left for you to do is to click on that shiny green button to update your changes to the original repository.

Congratulations! You have successfully updated your profile on our website!

Note that on GitHub (but also when writing research articles), we write in **markdown**, which is a set of conventions allowing to quickly and easily format text (e.g., text in bold, italic, titles, etc.).

- [**To read: markdown introduction**](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

2. **Create your own first repo**

Now, create your first repository! You can leave it mostly empty for now, it's just an experiment ground :relaxed:

- [**To read: markdown introduction**](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

3. **Make a PR in this document here**

Now that you have a better idea of GitHub, time to create a PR to add something to the Onboarding repository (this one). You can for example:

  - Fix a typo in this document
  - Add some recommended good movies/reads
  - Clarify some sections
  - ...

- [Github Cheatsheet](https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet)


## üìÜ Day 3: Get familiar with the tools


### Python

We mostly use Python for signal processing and setting up experimental tasks. For instance, the [NeuroKit2](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit) project that we are working on is written in Python.
We also build our experimental tasks using [Neuropsydia.py](https://github.com/neuropsychology/Neuropsydia.py) which is also a Python module.

Therefore, it's important that you get familiar with the tool. Following are a few resources that we suggest to get you started:

- [Get familiar with Python in 10 minutes](https://neurokit2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/learn_python.html)

### R

The bulk of our statistical analyses and manuscript preparation is done on R.

At this point, you might ask why can't we just stick to one programming language? What is the point of learning both R and Python?
The simple answer is that the two programming languages are basically different and one can be more powerful in one task than the other.
This [**blog post** *(R or Python for Psychologists)*](https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/post/r_or_python/) will however give you a much more interesting answer to the above question.\

Following are a few resources to get you started with R:

- [Introduction to R](http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction)

# Some Final Words

We encourage you to really explore and be integrated within the online scientific community along with us, as this will help you expand your knowledge and skillset as well as become better informed! It may be a steep learning curve initially, but we're here to help you along the way (we've been there ourselves!) and never hesitate to ask questions üòâ
